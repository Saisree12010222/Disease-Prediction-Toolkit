# Disease Prediction Toolkit

## Project Overview
This project uses a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease. The model, a Logistic Regression classifier, was trained and evaluated on a real-world health dataset.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of **XX.XX%** on the test data. ### Confusion Matrix
The model's performance on the test set is broken down as follows:
- **Correctly Predicted Healthy:** - **Correctly Predicted Diseased:** - **Incorrectly Predicted Diseased:** - **Incorrectly Predicted Healthy:** ## How to Run
The complete code for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation is contained in the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and Python script (`.py`) files in this repository.
